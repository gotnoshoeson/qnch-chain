Stage Two): All submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated by the Judges and by Public Voting in Stage Two as defined below:


Judges. Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”), and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

Technological Implementation

Design

Potential Impact

How big of an impact could the project have on the target community? How big of an impact could it have beyond the target community?

Quality of the Idea

How creative and unique is the project? Does the concept exist already? If so, how much does the project improve on it?

 

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.

Public Voting. During the Public Voting Period, Submissions will be posted on the Hackathon Site project gallery for Devpost users to submit their votes. Voting results will not be displayed publicly. Public voting for the Hackathon will take place during a voting period specified on the Hackathon Website.

Tie Breaking 

For each Prize listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.
